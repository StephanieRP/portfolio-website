								<h3>I am going learn to code!
								</h3>
								<p>This came has been my mindset for a couple of years now. I first was exposed to the world of coding when I sat in an introduction to programming with a college friend of mine.</p>

								<p>I have always been a computer nerd. Breaking apart a computer and figuring out how to put it back has always excited me. However, I have always thought back to the programming class I sat in, it was very simple lesson, just learning how to use HTML and CSS. It was amazing to me that you could create something so complex as a website a bunch of code. </p>

								<p>It has been a long journey of tinkering in various tutorials and programs online. I have enjoyed learning about tags using HTML and selectors using CSS. I found out quickly that the fun had just started.</p>

								<hr />

								<h4>Enter Javascript</h4>
								<p>When I started learning Javascript through Team Treehouse, I could create an array, understood what objects are. I got the syntax of the language, however I had hit a wall. </p>

								<p>I wasn’t able to really grasp the language as quickly as I did the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I realized if I am going to make this my career and eventually learn other languages, I need to get serious.</p>

								<hr />


								<h3>Enter Lambda School
								</h3>
								<p>I am a Youtube addict, I use it not only to learn about programming but also rest my brain to travel the world without leaving my room. I had found out about a great program called Lamdba School’s Computer Science Program, and I thought, this is what I need!</p>

								<p>I have been self-teaching myself for a while, but I felt I need some more interaction with other programmers and more pressure to really use what I am learning.  </p>

								<p>So I took the leap, completed the Pre-course and finished the Lambda Challenge and was finally able to book my interview with the school’s Admissions lead. </p>

								<p>Now I feel confident, and I am ready for what is next. Hopefully the interview goes well. Let hope so!</p>
